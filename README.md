# Avalon Media System Installer

*Warning: this script only installs Avalon 5.x-stable, it does not support Avalon 6.x. If you'd like to have an easy way to stand up the Avalon stack, please look at our [Docker instructions](https://github.com/avalonmediasystem/avalon-docker).*

To install the Avalon Media System using this installer and either [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) or [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet), please see the relevant instructions on the  [Avalon Media System wiki](https://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/display/VarVideo/Manual+Installation+of+Avalon+Using+Puppet).
